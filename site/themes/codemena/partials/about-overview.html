<h1 class="green-text">Our Story</h1>
<p>After several years of running startups and suffering from poorly-designed products, we set out to solve the problem that plagued not just us, but hundreds of startups across the region.</p>
<p>We traveled around the world studying the practices of elite tech startups and renouned software agencies attending events and workshops across Europe and North America.</p>
<p>The result is Code MENA, a boutique design and development agency that merges the quality, culture, and workflows of the most cutting-edge companies around the world, while bringing an understanding of the MENA region and the average Arab consumer.</p>
<p>Code MENA was founded in early 2018 with one goal: help startups build amazing products that their users will love using.</p>
<p>Our agency proudly holds its headquarters in Amman, Jordan with remote branches in the United States and United Kingdoms.</p>
